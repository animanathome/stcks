== MOBILE == 

- Fix menu screen so it occupies an entire screen instead of squash the exiting elements
- Add fixed title bar showing column names (ticker, company name, price, position, ...)
- Create a minimized version of the menu screen
- Remove white space around graphs (to optimize screen real estate)
- Add transparancy to secondary lines (overlap)
- Determine use of the additional data points - should the be used an overlay or do they require their own dedicated graph.
- Have a mobile specific css file - stroke-width 1px (instead of 2px on desktop)
